    <h3>Movie Poster Recommendation System</h3>
    <p>Movie posters are an essential part of identifying a movie. They are attention grabbers and often the first thing that the audience associates with the movie and grabs the attention. The poster is a visual representation of the movie’s theme, the characters and the style of the movie. Building on this, in this project our main goal was to leverage the context of the poster and make it an integral part of a movie recommendation system. We developed a system to recommend movies based on features such as color and composition of the posters and extracting textual information describing the image. The suggestions cater to user preferences and the context of movies they currently enjoy.</p>
    <p>To accomplish this, we built 3 main features in our application- an initial recommendation based on poster selected my users, a text search that allows the user to input a query relating to the poster/movie that returns a list of 10 movies they might be interested in and an image search which on uploading an image, a list of 10 movies are returned with context similar to the input image. In the project, we used cosine similarity to calculate similarity, BM25 along with DESM to perform ranking and a neural network model to derive context from images.</p>

      <h3>Proposed solution / methods used</h3>
	    <ul>
      <li>BM25: We employed the BM25 ranking algorithm, which is a variant of the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weighting scheme. BM25 helps in measuring the relevance of textual information extracted from movie posters and enables effective ranking of movies based on user preferences.</li>
      <li>DESM (Deep Embedding Semantic Model): The DESM technique was utilized to enhance the recommendation system. DESM employs deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of textual content, enabling a more accurate understanding of the movie's context and capturing the relationship between movies.</li>
      <li>TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): TF-IDF was employed to analyze and extract meaningful features from the textual information associated with movie posters. It helps in quantifying the importance of each word in the document, aiding in understanding the context and relevance of movies.</li>
      <li>Word2Vec: Word2Vec, a popular word embedding model, was utilized to transform textual data into a numerical representation. This transformation allows for semantic understanding and similarity analysis between movie descriptions, enhancing the recommendation process.</li>
      <li>ViT-GPT2-Image-Captioning: Visual Transformer (ViT) models combined with GPT-2 and image captioning techniques were used to obtain contextual information from movie posters. This approach captures visual cues and provides a deeper understanding of the visual content, allowing for more accurate recommendations.</li>
      <li>CLIPImageProcessor: CLIPImageProcessor, which is based on Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), was employed to generate visual embeddings from movie posters. These embeddings capture the visual information and facilitate similarity comparisons between different movie posters.</li>

  	 </ul>
    <p>In the recommendation process, we leveraged these techniques and models to calculate cosine similarity between textual and visual embeddings, aiding in the generation of personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and the contextual similarity between movies.</p>
    <p>By incorporating these diverse methods, our movie recommendation system can effectively analyze both textual and visual content, providing accurate and context-aware recommendations to users.</p>

      <h3>Evaluation and analysis of results</h3>
      <p>No specific metric was employed to test the application but we had tested the system with various examples. Attached below are screenshots from testing the 3 different functionalities. Custom queries can also be tested out here -

      <h3>Conclusions / discussion</h3>
      <p>Our system has been quite successful in returning movie results from both image and text queries along with providing personalized recommendations based on liked movies. We believe that there is more scope to this project as a similar model can be applied on movie clips that have been sourced from various places like social media applications and on providing this information to the application, the model will provide a potential list of movies that clip could be from. </p>
